# Modern JavaScript

üëã hi there! My name is [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)! This is a
workshop repo to teach you all about Modern JavaScript!

## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

In order for us to maximize our efforts during the workshop, please do the
following:

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch
      [Use Zoom for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-use-zoom-for-kcd-workshops)
      (~8 minutes).
- [ ] Watch
      [Setup and Logistics for KCD Workshops](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-setup-and-logistics-for-kcd-workshops)
      (~24 minutes). Please do NOT skip this step.
- [ ] Attend my
      [JavaScript Fundamentals Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/javascript-fundamentals)
      or have the equivalent fundamental understanding and experience with
      JavaScript syntax and features.

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## Workshop Outline

Here are the topics we'll be covering:

- Block Scoping: `let` and `const`
- Template Literals
- New Built-in APIs
- Destructuring
- Modules
- Object Literals
- Object/Array rest/spread
- Function spread, argument defaults and rest
- Arrow functions
- Classes

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v10 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

You should be able to work through the entire workshop in the browser. This is
actually the recommended approach as it requires absolutely no setup whatsoever.
Go to
[this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/modern-javascript)
and click `Fork` in the top right corner. Then click the `+` in the terminal and
you can run `npm test` to get the test watch mode started.

[![Edit modern-javascript](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/modern-javascript)

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer, then
follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/modern-javascript.git
cd modern-javascript
npm run setup --silent
```

This may take a few minutes. **It will ask you for your email.** This is
optional and just automatically adds your email to the links in the project to
make filling out some forms easier If you get any errors, please read through
them and see if you can find out what the problem is. You may also want to look
at [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). If you can't work it out on your own
then please [file an issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the
commands you ran (even if it's a lot).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

**Your goal is to make all tests pass**

## Helpful Emoji üê® üí∞ üíØ ü¶â üìú üí£ üö®

Each exercise has comments in it to help you get through the exercise. These fun
emoji characters are here to help you.

- **Kody the Koala Bear** üê® will tell you when there's something specific you
  should do
- **Marty the Money Bag** üí∞ will give you specific tips (and sometimes code)
  along the way
- **Hannah the Hundred** üíØ will give you extra challenges you can do if you
  finish the exercises early.
- **Olivia the Owl** ü¶â will give you useful tidbits/best practice notes and a
  link for elaboration and feedback.
- **Dominic the Document** üìú will give you links to useful documentation
- **Berry the Bomb** üí£ will be hanging around anywhere you need to blow stuff
  up (delete code)
- **Alfred the Alert** üö® will occasionally show up in the test failures with
  potential explanations for why the tests are failing.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>"npm run setup" command not working</summary>

Here's what the setup script does. If it fails, try doing each of these things
individually yourself:

```
# verify your environment will work with the project
node ./scripts/verify

# install dependencies
npm install

# verify the project is ready to run
npm run build
npm run test:final
```

If any of those scripts fail, please try to work out what went wrong by the
error message you get. If you still can't work it out, feel free to [open an
issue][issue] with _all_ the output from that script. I will try to help if I
can.

## Thanks

Special thanks to [Aaron Frost](https://twitter.com/js_dev) and
[Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) for creating the
[original repo](https://github.com/aaronfrost/es6-workshop) which was forked to
my original [es6-workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/es6-workshop) and then
I moved some of that content here. The project has undergone a LOT of changes,
but much of the same ideas were developed by Axel and Aaron. Thanks!
